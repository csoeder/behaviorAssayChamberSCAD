# Introduction

This repository contains plans and models for equipment used to study behavior in fruit flies. These have been designed and renedered using OpenSCAD and fabricated by 3D printing and/or router milling. 

# The Food/Oviposition Choice Chamber

A lower base holds petri dishes containing food, optionally with odorants or other chemicals added, and an upper plate restricts access to a choice of two at a time. A petri dish into a groove on the plate, containing a fly under observation. The attraction/repulsion from the dishes and their feeding and egg-laying habits are noted.

Requires fabrication of: one base and one plate

# The Mate Choice Chamber

A base holds a male fly in each of the two side chambers, contained by the top and bottom lids of a petri dish. A female fly is similarly contained in a central chamber. The chambers are separated by a sliding barrier, which moves an open window into the passage between when pulled. The female is observed and her mating behavior noted. Assembly clips and a backstop on the slider set proper spacing; another set of clips prevents the sliders from levering upwards during operation. A thin dowel (not printed) is used to connect the pull-tabs of the two sliders, so that both doors are opened simultaneously. 

Requires fabrication of: one base, two sliders, and four assembly clips (optional)
